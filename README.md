# Business Understanding
The ability to accurately monitor carbon emissions is a critical step in the fight against climate change. Precise carbon readings allow researchers and governments to understand the sources and patterns of carbon mass output. While Europe and North America have extensive systems in place to monitor carbon emissions on the ground, there are few available in Africa.

## Objectives
The objective of this challenge is to create machine learning or a deep learning model using open-source CO2 emissions data (from Sentinel-5P satellite observations) to predict carbon emissions.

## Model Selection
This project uses the **Ensemble Technique(simple averaging)**.
The models are:
1. LightGBM model
2. XgBoost model

## Success Metric
The model performance of this project will be analyzed using the mean squared error.
